# Bar-Library assistant bot

How many times did u came to the store, stop in front of the wine shelf for a long time and try to remember which of these you tried and what exactly did you like?
This bot will make your life easier. You no longer need to think about the title of the wine - this bot will do it for you!
Upload all the information to the bot library through the convenient menu and get it anytime, anywhere.

Now bot can store the information, sorting on taste\disgusting and on type of wine. Has short admin menu funtions

## To install:
1. Register new bot in bot_father
2. Create a config.py file on root folder (/root/config.py) setting all requirements without using space after "=".
```
ADMIN_ID = '...'
AVIALABLE_USERS = {...}
TOKEN = SECRET_BOT_TOCKEN from Bot_father
```
3. Run main.py

## Plan to upgrade
This was my first bot. I have achieved my goal - to study the Telegram API, aiogram3. I'll do a full refactoring of this code later, but I've posted it here as a material to compare how much my skill has grown.
